# Imputation using 1000G reference panel

This repository explains the steps involved in Whole Genome Imputation using 1000G as reference panel

## Fine Mapping
Imputation provides a higher-resolution view of a genetic region by adding more variants, thereby increasing the chances of identifying a causal variant.

## Meta-Analysis
Imputation also helps in meta-analysis by facilitating the combination of results across studies. Different studies often use different genotyping arrays containing different sets of variants. For instance, only 20% of the SNPs included on the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array are included on the Illumina 660K array. Genotype imputation can generate a common set of variants that can be analyzed across all the studies to boost power. 

## Increasing the Power of Association Studies
Another benefit of imputation lies in increasing the power to detect an association signal. When SNPs are genotyped in only a portion of the samples, imputation can increase the effective sample size by filling in the missing genotypes.
